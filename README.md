TITLE: Event-Connect: A Machine Learning-Based Event Recommendation System

Problem statement: In a city like Berlin, there are hundreds of things to do every single day from cultural festivals and art shows to tech conferences and business networking events. Users do not know where to look for events because the choice is overwhelming. Today's event websites present static lists and not intelligent suggestions. This lack of intelligent filtering renders the user less interactive and event exploration time-consuming and inefficient.


Proposed solution: The project proposes developing a Berlin Event Recommendation System utilizing machine learning and data-driven personalization to recommend events based on users' interests. Event data will be collected from public APIs or web scraping from sources such as Eventbrite, Meetup, or Berlin.de. The system will preprocess event data and use content-based filtering—applying TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to match user interest with event descriptions and categories. A light-weighted Flask-based web application will serve as the user interface where the user will enter preferences (e.g., music, technology, art) and be recommended personalized events.


Expected outcome: The expected deliverable is an operational prototype demonstrating how web applications supported by databases and machine learning methods can help improve discovery of local events. The project will display the integration of data collection, ML modeling, and web deployment and how computational techniques can enrich real-world user experiences in urban life.
